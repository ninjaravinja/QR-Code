# QR-Code

I have recently restarted this, using a much neater, well-explained and modular approach.

I am making my own QR Code generator to learn how it works, and to challenge myself to make my own implementation.

I have followed the tutorial [here](https://thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial) as I found it quite informative and explained each step clearly.


## Inspiration

I had an idea about a game/minigame where the player would navigate through a maze, and after completing it, it would reveal the maze as a QR code that could lead to an item or some other reward for completion.

The 'AI Proof of Concept' folder is a simple script that chooses a random start and end point and finds a path between the 2.

The 'Ben's Dijkstra' folder is an implementation of Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm implemented by my friend [bwscp173](https://github.com/bwscp173).

Instead of importing a library to make the code for me, i decided to learn how a QR code is generated myself and create my own implementation.
