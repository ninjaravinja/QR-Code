# QR-Code

I have recently restarted this, using a much neater, well-explained and modular approach.

I am making my own QR Code generator to learn how it works, and to challenge myself to make my own implementation.

I have followed the tutorial at https://thinky.com/qr-code-tutorial as I found it quite informative and explained each step clearly.
